The [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport) compatible oauth extension.

## Installation

```bash
composer require fof/passport:"*"
```

## Updating from Flagrow

This extension replaces [Flagrow Passport](https://packagist.org/packages/flagrow/passport).

To upgrade from the old extension to the new one:

- **Backup your data!**

- Disable the Passport extension in the admin panel.

- Run:

```sh
composer update fof/passport:"*"
```

Composer should let you know that `flagrow/passport` has been automatically removed.

- Enable the new extension in the admin panel.

- Your existing settings will be migrated to FoF Passport automatically.

- You should be good to go! All URLs stay the same.

## Configuration

In the extension settings, you have to fill the following data:

Setting | Example | Description
--- | --- | ---
OAuth authorization url | `https://example.com/oauth/authorize` | `<your laravel install>/oauth/authorize`
OAuth token url | `https://example.com/oauth/token` | `<your laravel install>/oauth/token`
Api URL providing user details when authenticated | `https://example.com/api/user` | Default Laravel installs have an `/api/user` route, otherwise point to a route returning the current user data (protected by the `passport` driver)
OAuth application id | `1` | The integer *Client ID* you've made in the Laravel app or via `artisan passport:client`
OAuth application secret | `abcdefghijABCDEFGHIJabcdefghijABCDEFGHIJ` | The *Client secret* provided by Laravel once you created the OAuth client
OAuth scopes to request | | Optional additional scopes to request during authorization, perhaps you want to protect the user url with a scope or add additional functionality
Label for login button | Login with Example | Label to place on the login button
Icon for login button | `far fa-id-card` | FontAwesome icon to place on the login button. [List of available icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free)

**Hint:** When creating the OAuth client in your Laravel app, don't forget to set the `redirect` value to `http://<your_flarum _install>/auth/passport` 

or you might encounter `invalid_client` errors.
